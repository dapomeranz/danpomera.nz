          For those of you who do not know me, my name is Dan and this is me on
          the right. I decided to make this website to learn more about web
          hosting and basic web development, since a lot of my web dev
          experience has been particularly library heavy and clunky.

          I spent the first four years on the outside looking in at software
          engineers, but have worked hard to move horizontally towards being a
          full time programmer. It is a challenge which I deeply enjoy and now
          wake up every day excited for what is next. With that in mind, I am
          always interested to learn more about the fields of operational
          technology, data engineering, and software engineering. If you are
          interested in chatting about these fields please reach out through any
          platform or through my email: dapomeranz@gmail.com

          face on mobile\n - Add a resume using nested text
